This repo provides a UI and library for configuring an interconnect chip. The only interconnect chip available is the lga36p_10x10mm model, the definition is given in the circuit json in the lib directory.

The home page consists of a dropdown at the top that allows you to select the interconnect chip, currently only one model is availabe, the lga36p_10x10mm_xalt_2025_11. When this is selected, we draw all the smtpads to the page. The user can hover over the pads and see the pin numbers, the name of the pad etc. When the user hovers over a pad, all pads connected to the same net show (note: this changes as the user configures connections). A tooltip over the the crossing pins (i.e. the "X" pins) says that they are non-configurable, and always cross diagonally over the chip. The "C" pins are configurable, as the user configures connections we draw an arrow out of the C pin.

Note: There are three different types of pads, each should be drawn slightly differently. There are two types of outer pins, "X" and "C" pins. All pins, if unused, are faded. "X" pins should be drawn in red, unused C pins should be drawn in gray. Used C pins should be drawn in a unique color selected for the net. Unused inner pins should be drawn in gray. Used inner pins should be drawn in the color selected for the net.

The user uses a table on the right to configure pins to connect. The table allows "Inserting a New Connection". The user can then "Add" or "Remove" pins to the connection. X pins are non-configurable, so if they are added to a connection they become used but you can't add additional connections. When adding C pins, all the added C pins become members of the same net. When a C pin is added, we draw a line that connects the two C pin nets, this means scanning for a place where inner pins or outer pins that are members of the c net can be connected. The matrix of pads is designed such that there is always at least one way to connect two nets together in a "single hop".
