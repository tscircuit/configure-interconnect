Configure a tscircuit interconnect chip

tscircuit interconnect chips allow "jumper programming" via
single-layer traces. By using an interconnect chip, you can
make single-layer PCBs capable of multi-layer routing.

This repo allows configure the standard 36 pin tscircuit
interconnect chip with an interactive website. This repo also
contains the main library code for the integration of the
interconnect chip into the [tscircuit autorouter](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit-autorouter)
